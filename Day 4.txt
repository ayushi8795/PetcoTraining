Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self,maxspeed, mileage):
        self.maxspeed = maxspeed
        self.mileage = mileage
        
v1 = Vehicle(23,56)
print(v1.maxspeed)
print(v1.mileage)



Create a Bus object that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class and display it.
Vehicle Name: School Volvo Speed: 180 Mileage: 12




class Vehicle:
    num = 1
    def __init__(self,speed, mileage):
        self.maxspeed = speed
        self.mileage = mileage
        # self.capacity = 6
        Vehicle.num += 1
    def oil(self,capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        price = capacity * 100
        
        return price
class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass
    
        
v1 = Vehicle(23,56)
print(v1.maxspeed)
print(v1.mileage)
b1 = Bus(34,76)
print(b1.maxspeed)
print(b1.mileage)
print(b1.oil(5))
print(Vehicle.num)
print(v1.num)
c1 = Vehicle(23,23)
print(Vehicle.num)






try:
    def abc(a,b):
        return (a/b)
        
    a1 = abc(10,2)
    print(a1)
    a2 = abc(10,1)
    print(a2)
    a3 = abc("a",0)
    print(a3)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    
    print("some error has occured")
except Exception as e:
    print("This error has occured",e)
finally:
    print("This is final statement")
# print(10/0)
